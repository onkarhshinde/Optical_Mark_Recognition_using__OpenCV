## Frist part: sending recieving done
- first character = 1 for exit
- first character = 0 for entry
- buffer time = 3 minutes


## Second part: getting registration






## Problems
- True physical mac address and publically shown mac addresses(randomised) are different
- Solution: ask students to open their hotspot and then enter their mac address.
- If youâ€™re building an attendance system that scans for hotspot MACs, you need the AP MAC, not the STA MAC.







## STEPS TO OPERATE:


- Set up mosquitto server.
- Set up MySQL server.
- run ```python app.py``` in macRollform
- Open scanCode.py from macRollform
- From SSID, copy bssid of a given student.
- In the webpage, paste that SSID and add roll No.
- Run script on M5Stack.
- Run reciveing and uploading script `1forall.ipynb` present in the `Mosquitto` folder.
